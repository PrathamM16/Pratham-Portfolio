## Instructions for Adding Your Resume

1. Create a PDF version of your resume
2. Name it `Pratham_M_Resume.pdf`
3. Place it in the `public` folder
4. The download button in the navbar will automatically link to it

Alternatively, you can generate a resume dynamically from your portfolio data using libraries like:
- `jsPDF` - Generate PDF from JavaScript
- `react-pdf` - React renderer for creating PDF files
- `puppeteer` - Generate PDF from HTML

For now, a placeholder link has been set up in the Navbar component.
